"""`export(format="wfdb")` refuses an option name it does not know (#410).

The wfdb exporter read `options.get("patient_ids")` and
`options.get("include_annotation_text")` and never looked at the rest of
the dict, so `export(folder, format="wfdb", patient_id=["P1"])` -- one
character off the frozen name -- **exported every patient**, with nothing
in the returned list of paths, the log, the audit table or the compliance
report saying the subset filter had been dropped. The same typo on
`format="dicom"` has always raised, because `_export_dicom` has a real
signature.

The two halves of this file are deliberately paired. R1 says the bad
call is refused, R2 says the good call is not: a check that rejects
everything fails R2, one that rejects nothing fails R1, and neither can
pass vacuously while the other holds. R3 is the coherence assertion the
issue is actually about, and R4 pins the allow-list itself -- which is a
thing `tests/test_wfdb_privacy.py`'s AST pin structurally cannot see,
for the reason its own docstring records.
