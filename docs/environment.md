# Environment Variables

You can tune the system performance and behavior using environment variables. These can be set in your shell or in a `.env` file in the project root.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`GANTRY_LOG_LEVEL`** | `DEBUG` | Logging verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`). |
| **`GANTRY_DB_PATH`** | `gantry.db` | Path to the SQLite session database. |
| **`GANTRY_MAX_WORKERS`** | *Auto* | Override the number of parallel worker processes. Default is `CPU_COUNT * 1.5`. |
| **`GANTRY_CHUNKSIZE`** | `1` | Batch size for inter-process communication. Increasing this (e.g. to 5 or 10) can improve performance for very small items. |
| **`GANTRY_MAX_TASKS_PER_CHILD`** | *Unlimited* | Restart worker processes after N tasks to release memory. Useful if you suspect memory leaks in underlying libraries. |
| **`GANTRY_DISABLE_GC`** | `0` | Set to `1` to disable Garbage Collection in worker processes. This can speed up processing significantly but increases memory usage. |
| **`GANTRY_FORCE_THREADS`** | `0` | Set to `1` to force using Threads instead of Processes (bypass multiprocessing). Useful for debugging or when running in environments that don't support `fork`. |
| **`GANTRY_SHOW_PROGRESS`** | `1` | Set to `0` to globally disable all progress bars (tqdm). Useful for cleaner logs in CI/CD environments. |
